# PCB DESIGN with EAGLE 


To develop the PCB with EAGLE, instead of using the symbols and footprints of the various components, we used the Connectors from the *Sparkfun* library.
In this way we used all the available space and we developed a more compact PCB.

We used:
- For the PSOC &#x2192; 22 connectors, carefully spaced in order to follow the component dimensions.
- For the IMU &#x2192; 6 connectors, carefully spaced in order to follow the component dimensions.
- For the HC-06 Bluetooth module &#x2192; 4 connectors in order to follow the component dimensions.
- For the voltage regulator &#x2192; 3 connectors.
- For the battery &#x2192; 2 connectors.
- For the LED and for the button (not used later on) &#x2192; 2 connectors. 
- For the 330&#8486; LED resistance (not used later on) &#x2192; component symbol and footprint.  

After developing the PCB with the standard procedure we soldered the female headers on it and we added the components.
